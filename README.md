# Iris

A toy language built without normal regex. It's slightly functional. 

Codebase is a mess. More-so a proof of concept to learn more about language design. 

If you're curious about the Iris's syntax, you can find the reference [here](https://github.com/Sanjay-B/Iris/blob/legacy/documentation/docs.md).
